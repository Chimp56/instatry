Introduction 

Generative-AI has been taking over the internet like storm, specifically in creative apps and marketplaces like, Pinterest Etsy, and even parts of Amazon, a lot of the content now is to be overflooded by AI rather than users, which has popularized a theory in 2024 going into 2025: The Dead Internet Theory: where all of the generated content on the internet is of bots and AI rather than users. Even when looking at new clothing or haircut inspiration at oneâ€™s next visit has become difficult in the new day and age of technology. For our project, we want to try to solve this problem in a new and innovative way and find a balance between Gen-AI by using it in an effective way. Our solution: InstaFit - a fashion marketplace, where users can browse for clothes for purchasing or for inspiration, as well as being able to try on some clothing through Augmented Reality (AR). 

Chosen UI / Project Goals 

The InstaFit user interface (UI) will focus like a personalized E-commerce experience for Desktop and Mobile (Responsive Design): 

Create accounts. 

Browse the marketplace with optional filters. 

Be able to view individual items and details. 

Use AR try-on functionality on applicable garments. 

Upload and scan their own clothing to integrate with AR try-ons. 

Have an AI verifier in the backend. 

 

Identified Issues 

Lack of interactive shopping experience. 

AI-Generated Fashion products. 

Trust & authenticity within E-commerce, specifically in creative/art products. 

 

 

 

Related Works 

Marketplaces like Amazon and Etsy exist and are reputable but they lack AR try-on functionality. Pinterest shopping offers fashion inspiration but again does not support teal-time virtual try-on or authenticity verification of any sort. There are products like ASOS, but they are limited and do not address the need for users to be able to upload their work or own clothes. Instead, they only include a pre-existing try-on.
